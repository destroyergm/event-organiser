# Event organiser

## About
This is my personal solution to the assigment on the [Odin Project Website](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations). The application is about making events, and
inviting users to join. Each user can attend multiple events, each of the events takes place
at a location and assosiated time with that location.

Note: Currently, the given solution is *not tested well*, since I haven't learned TDD properly yet.

## Features
 - Create new users for the web-app
 - Make events that users can attend to
 - Users can invite other users to events, other users can accept, decline
